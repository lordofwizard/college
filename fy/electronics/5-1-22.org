* Components
** Active and passive components.
*** Active Components
  components which needs power to start / run are active components.
  - Transistors
  - BJT,
  - JFET
  - MOSFET
  - Operational Amplifier
*** Passive Components
components which can temporarily store energy.
- Resistors
- LDF
- Thermistor
- Capacitor
- Inductor
- Switch
- Variable Resistor
- Resistor.

*** Difference Betwene Active and Passive.
1) Active Devices inject power to the circuit, wereas passive devices are incapable are incable of supplying any energy.
2) Active devices are capable of providing power gain, and passive devices are incapable of providing power gain.
3) Active devices can control the current (energy) flow within the circuit, whereas passive devices cannot control it.
4) An external power is required to start basic operation of an active device where no extra power is used for passive devices.

*** Resistor
**** What is a resistor?
- Resistor is a passive circuit element which opposes the flow of current / electricity.

*** Types of resistors.
***** Carbon composition Resistors.
Created with Carbon Particles + Binder Clay. Ceramic substrate .. with change of helix we can change the resistance value.
***** Wirewound Resistor
***** Metal Oxide resistor.
***** Variable Resistor
** Types of inductors
*** AIR CORE INDUCTOR
high frequency inductor.
*** Iron core inductor.
Used in Audio Equipment.
*** Laminated Inductor.
*** Ferrite Core Inductor.
Created with ferromagnetic material.\\
Used in Radio Applications.
*** Trodial Inductors.
Very low frequency.
*** Variable Inductor.
Used in printed Circuits.
