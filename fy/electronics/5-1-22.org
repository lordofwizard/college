* Components
** Active and passive components.
*** Active Components
  components which needs power to start / run are active components.
  - Transistors
  - BJT,
  - JFET
  - MOSFET
  - Operational Amplifier
*** Passive Components
components which can temporarily store energy.
- Resistors
- LDF
- Thermistor
- Capacitor
- Inductor
- Switch
- Variable Resistor
- Resistor.

*** Difference Betwene Active and Passive.
1) Active Devices inject power to the circuit, wereas passive devices are incapable are incable of supplying any energy.
2) Active devices are capable of providing power gain, and passive devices are incapable of providing power gain.
3) Active devices can control the current (energy) flow within the circuit, whereas passive devices cannot control it.
4) An external power is required to start basic operation of an active device where no extra power is used for passive devices.
