#+TITLE:  RIGID BODY MECHANICS

* Studing external effect of forces on a body such as
- velocity
- acceleration
- displacement.
**** point 2
    Studing internal effect of forces on a body such as stresses (internal resistance) , change in shape,etc.
*** Statics
Deals with forces and its effects when the body is at rest.
*** Dynamics
 Deals with forces and its effects when the body is in moving condition.

** Rigit Body Mechanics
- Negligible deformation: no deformation under the action of forces.
- Assuming 100% strength in the materials. I, arge number of particles occupying fixed postions with each other
- Actual Structures and machines are never rigid under the action of external loads or forces.
- but the deformations induced are usually very small which does not affect the condition of equilibrium.
** Addition of vectors.
