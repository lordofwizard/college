#+TITLE:  RIGID BODY MECHANICS

* Studing external effect of forces on a body such as
- velocity
- acceleration
- displacement.
**** point 2
    Studing internal effect of forces on a body such as stresses (internal resistance) , change in shape,etc.
*** Statics
Deals with forces and its effects when the body is at rest.
*** Dynamics
 Deals with forces and its effects when the body is in moving condition.

** Rigit Body Mechanics
- Negligible deformation: no deformation under the action of forces.
- Assuming 100% strength in the materials. I, arge number of particles occupying fixed postions with each other
- Actual Structures and machines are never rigid under the action of external loads or forces.
- but the deformations induced are usually very small which does not affect the condition of equilibrium.

** Effects of a force:
A force may be produce the following effects in a body, on which it acts:
1) It may change the motion of a body i.e if a body is at rest, the force may set it in motion, And if the body is already in motion, the force may accelerate it.
2) It may retard the motion of a body.
3) It may retard the forces, already acting on a body, thus bringing it to rest or in equilibrium. we shall study this effect in equilibrium.
4) It may give rise to internal stresses in the body. on which it acts. We shall study this effect in the chapters 'Analysis of perfect Frames.'.
