* Engineeering Mechanics.
*MEANING* It is study of state of rigit body under applications of forces(external).
- Study -> *observer*, object & observations i.e it will observe physical quantity which are for example Mass, velocity force torque.
- Rigit body -> solid (rigit and deformable), Liquid and Gas.
- Forces -> It is some effect of external agent when applied to body, it can change the state of body.

** Entra point:
As a matter of fact knowledge of Engineering Mechanics is _very_ _essential_ for an engineer in *planning* *designing* and *constuction* of his various types of structure and machine.
** Units:
*** Fundamental Units
 Every quantity is measured in terms of some arbitrary, but internationally accepted units called as fundamental units.
 1. Length
 2. Mass
 3. Time.
*** Derived Units
 Sometimes, the units are also expressed in other units which are derived from fundamental units known as derived units. e.g. units of area, velocity, acceleration, pressure etc.
*** Systems of units
There are only four systems of unit which are ocmmandly used and universally recognised.
These are known as:
1. C.G.S
2. F.P.S
3. M.K.S
4. S.I
**** S.I units:
The eleventh general conference of weights and measured has recommended a unifeed and systematically constituted system of fundamental are derived its for international use. This system of units is now being used in many countries.

**** Basic Terminology
- _Mass_ : the quantity of matter possed by a body is called mass.
- _Time_ : The time is the measure of succession of events
- _Space_ : The geometric region in which study of body is involved is called space.
- _Length_ : It is concept to measure linear distances
- _Displacement_ : distance moved by a particle in a specified direction
- _Velocity_: The rate of change of Displacement with respect to time.
- _Acceleration_: Rate of change of velocity with respect to time.
- _Momentum_: Product of mass and velocity
- _Continumm_: Continuous Distribution of matter
- _Rigit Body_: A body is said to be rigit if the relative positions of any two particles do not change under the action of the forces acting on it.
- _Particle_ : A particle may be defined as an object which has only mass and no size.

| The scalar quantites (or sometimes known as scalars) are those quantities which have magnitude only such as length lengh mass time distance volume density temprature speed | the vector quantities (or sometimes known as vectors) are those quantities which have both magnitude and direction such as force, displacement, velocity, acceleration, momentum, |

**** Vector
***** Representation of a vector
A vector is represented by a directed line. It maybe noted that lengh OA-> represents the magnitude of a vector OA. The direction of the vector is OA is from O (i.e, starting point) to A (i.e, End point). It is also known as vector P.
***** Unit Vector
A vector whose magnitude is unity(0), is known as unit vector.
***** Equal vectors
The vectors, which are parallel to eachother and have same direction (i.e same sence) and equal magnitutde are known as equal vectors.
***** Like Vectors
The vectors, which are parallel to each other and have same sence but unequal magnitude, are known as like vectors.
**** Force
- Newton's First law states that everybody continues in it's state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless it compelled by an external agency acting on it. This leads to the defination of force as ' force is an external egency which changes or trends to change the state of rest or uniform linear motion of the body'
- magnitude of force is defined by Newton's second law. It states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the impressed force and it takes place in the direction of force acting on it.
