* Unit 1
*** Forms of energy
*Energy : The capacity or ability for doing work. It may exist in potential, kinetic, thermal, electrical, chemical, nuclear or other vairous forms.*
- Thermal Energy
- chemical Energy
- Electrical energy
- mechanical energy
- nuclear energy
- gravitational energy.

- Classification of energy sources:
  - [X] Renewable / non conventional energy sources. \\
    solar,tidal,wind,hydrogen,biomass etc.
  - [X] Non renewable / conventional energy sources. \\
    coal, fossile fuel etc.
**** Thermal Energy
Thermal = heat \\
energy produced by heat and that heat comes from moment's of objects tiny particles. \\
or
energy of systems or substances which is related to temprature. \\
**** Grades of energy
1) high grade energy
2) low grade energy
- *Introduction of energy sources and it's conversion.*
*** Thermal / Steam energy:

*** Advantanges of thermal (steam) power plants :
1) fuel used is cheaper.
2) They can respond quickly with changes in load on the plant.
3) space required is less compared to hydro power plants.
4) A portion of steam can be used as process steam for various industries.
5) Cost of electric power generation and its initial cost is less compared to diesel plants.
6) can be located near the load centre conveniently thus reduces the transmission line cost and loss of energy transmission lines.
*** Disadvantages of thermal (steam) power plants :
1) time needed for errection of plant is high before it is put to operation.
2) Large quantity of water is needed
3) coal and ash handling process is a seroious problem.
4) the part load effciency is low.
5) pollution causes health problems to workers and habitants near the thermal power plant.
